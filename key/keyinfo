In the event you want to manually import or set Keys please follow these guidelines:
    *Only one key file per key folder containing one set of keys. AnonFinder will use the Key that is provided there.
    *If an API requires multiple keys please input the keys as they are entered in or on the key provider in
        ex. Twitter API Keys:
            (Consumer Key)wadfqt24q3greeag
            (consumer secret key)23ljk23lsdkjflsdajf
            (token key)lkljfsl32kjlksjdflkst
            (token secret)lsdfajk2l4kjlksdgjl24
    * Also keep your keys safe and maintain and update them frequently.
    * There will also be a post on this page to show you how to acquire keys for the various APIs
